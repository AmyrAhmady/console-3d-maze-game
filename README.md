# Console 3D Maze Game

## Information
A simple console based 3D maze game written in C++, which only works on windows at the moment until I find a way to write buffer directly to console output with colors

## Notes
If you ever see random characters on walls instead of block characters ( █, ▓, ▒, and ░ ), try to set your project `Character Set` to Unicode instead of Multi-byte or whatever it is set to.

## Preview
(No, preview is not laggy, it's your internet trying to load this ~6mb GIF file! it will be fine when it's finally done loading all frames.)
